## Unity OOJU CAIG: AI-Powered Editor Toolkit (Scene Analysis, Interaction & Animation)

An intuitive Unity Editor plugin that leverages AI for scene understanding and interaction suggestions, alongside powerful editor-based object animation tools to streamline your development workflow.

### âœ¨ Features

OOJU CAIG provides a suite of powerful tools integrated directly into the Unity Editor to help you understand your scene's structure, brainstorm interactions, and bring your objects to life.

1.  **Scene Description & Analysis**
    * Analyze your current Unity scene using OpenAI and generate a natural language summary of the main objects and their relationships.
    * Quickly understand the overall structure, layout, and key elements of your scene.

2.  **Interaction Suggestions**
    * Get AI-powered suggestions for possible player interactions with selected objects in your scene.
    * The plugin can distinguish between decorative/static objects and interactive ones, and recommends suitable actions for each.

3.  **Object Auto-Animation**
    * Easily apply various animations (Hover, Wobble, Spin, Shake, Bounce, etc.) to GameObjects with just a few clicks in the Editor.
    * Adjust animation parameters such as speed and intensity directly from the UI.

4.  **Relational Animations**
    * Apply animations based on relationships between objects, such as Orbit, LookAt, Follow, MoveAlongPath, and SnapToObject.
    * Assign reference objects to create complex, relationship-based animations directly in the Editor.

5.  **Editor-Only, Non-Intrusive**
    * All features are provided through a dedicated Editor window, ensuring no unnecessary code is included in your runtime builds.
    * Runtime components (like ObjectAutoAnimator) are only included if you choose to use them.

6.  **Optional AI Integration**
    * Enter your OpenAI API Key to enable scene description and interaction suggestion features.
    * All animation features work without an API key.

7.  **User-Friendly UI/UX**
    * Intuitive tabbed interface for scene analysis, interaction suggestions, animation management, and settingsâ€”all in one place.
